The information presented here will empower Android users to leverage this potentially life-saving tool for enhanced personal security [1].

The Android Emergency SOS feature serves as a vital lifeline in urgent circumstances, offering several key functionalities. Primarily, it enables an **instant connection to help** by quickly initiating a call to emergency services without requiring the user to manually search for and dial a number [1]. This is particularly crucial in situations where time is of the essence and every second counts [2]. Secondly, the feature facilitates **location sharing**, automatically sending the user's current location to pre-designated emergency contacts and, in some cases, to emergency responders [1, 3]. This capability significantly aids first responders in locating the individual in need, especially if the user is unable to communicate their whereabouts. Furthermore, Emergency SOS includes the function of sending **emergency alerts to contacts**, notifying them of the situation and often including the user's location [3, 4]. This ensures that loved ones are aware of the emergency and can provide support or seek additional help. Finally, some Android implementations offer an **emergency video recording** option, which, when activated, starts recording a video that can be automatically backed up and shared with emergency contacts, providing valuable context about the situation [3, 4]. The capacity to instantly connect to emergency services and simultaneously share location information drastically cuts down the time required for assistance to arrive during a crisis. The integration of features like video recording signifies a developing trend towards incorporating richer media into emergency communications, potentially offering a more comprehensive understanding of the situation to those who can help.
